# GSP006: Monitoring Cloud Infrastructure with Stackdriver

To complete this lab, you'll need:

* Access to a standard internet browser (Chrome browser recommended).
* Time. Note the lab's Duration in the Lab Details tab in Qwiklabs, which is an estimate of the time it should take to complete all steps. Plan your schedule so you have time to complete the lab. Once you start the lab, you will not be able to pause and return later (you begin at step 1 every time you start a lab).
* You do NOT need a Google Cloud Platform account or project. An account, project and associated resources are provided to you as part of this lab.
* If you already have your own GCP account, make sure you do not use it for this lab.
* If your lab prompts you to log into the console, use only the student account provided to you by the lab. This prevents you from incurring charges for lab activities in your personal GCP account.
